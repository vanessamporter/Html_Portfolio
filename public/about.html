<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi!  My name is Vanessa Porter.  I love all things organized, beautiful and functional.  I really enjoy web pages 
  that are all of those things as well as minimalistic.  Minimalistic web sites don't have to be boring or low on information!  
  They can convey everything you need while also while remaining fresh and uncluttered.  Glad to meet you! </p>

<p>I have an interest in cyber secruity as well as front end web development.  I have worked hard to pursure education 
  in both fields and offer a unique perspective by having some knowledge in both fields.
</p>

<p>I am an excellent communicator and can work effectively both on a team and individually.  
  I enjoy continuing education and it's a good thing because that it is necessary in the tech industry.  
  one of my favorite quotes is: “The Only Constant in Life Is Change.”- Heraclitus
